# Component Library: Starter Kit

A light, customizable frontend starter kit for the Imarc Component Library.


## Installation

```bash
  npx pronto-kit
```

## Icons
`main-icons-sprite.svg` Will also be copied over to your base directory. How this needs to be included may differ based on a particular CMS or project. As long as the svg sheet is included in the base template right after the opening `<body>` tag, it should work just fine.
